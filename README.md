A Python-based mini gaming center that features three classic games in one terminal interface: Tic Tac Toe, Slot Machine, and Bagels (number guessing). Players can interactively choose games, earn points, and enjoy varied logic-based challenges. The project demonstrates the use of modular functions, randomization, user input handling, and game state trackingâ€”all through a simple command-line experience. Ideal for learning Python fundamentals and practicing control flow, loops, and conditionals in game development.
